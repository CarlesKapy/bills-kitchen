<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You only need to install <strong>VirtualBox</strong> from <a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.1.14/VirtualBox-4.1.14-77440-Win.exe">here</a>, everything else comes already preinstalled.</p>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Mount the DevPack to the <code>W:\</code> drive by double-clicking the <code>mount-w-drive.bat</code> file. Then open a command prompt (either <code>cmd</code> or <code>W:\tools\console2\Console.exe</code>) and call the <code>W:\set-env.bat</code> script. This will set up your environment so that you have all the required tools in the PATH and you are ready to <a href="file://W:/_GETTING_STARTED.html">GETTING_STARTED</a> with Chef, Vagrant and Co.</p>
